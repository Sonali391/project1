  How It Works

1. Users sign up as either Mentor or Mentee  
2. Firebase stores user profiles securely  
3. Matching logic (planned with AI) suggests mentor-mentee pairs  
4. Users engage in real-time using chat/video tools  
5. Progress is tracked and feedback is collected  

 Security & Ethics

- All user data is stored securely via Firebase with proper rules  
- Clear consent and privacy statements for elder participants  
- No third-party tracking; transparent data use policies
